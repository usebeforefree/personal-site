## Reed-Solomon erasure encoding library written in Zig

Reed-Solomon encoding is a method used to add redundancy to data before transmission or storage, allowing for error detection and correction. It works by treating data as polynomials and adding extra symbols (parity bits) to help recover the original message if errors occur during transmission.
